# Daily Surgery Demand Forecasting in an Operating Room Using Linear Regression
# Problem Definition
A large hospital has 55 operating rooms. The scheduling for surgeries in these rooms is planned several weeks in advance. Surgeries can be scheduled from 4 weeks to 1 day before the surgery date based on the surgeons' preferences and plans. Every day at 5 PM, the list of surgeries for the following day is finalized, and no elective surgeries can be scheduled for the next day after this point. However, emergency surgeries might be added to the next day's schedule, or some surgeries may be canceled due to medical conditions. These changes and the uncertainty in the exact number of surgeries each day can impact the overall schedule. Surgeries are categorized into elective and emergency types. Elective surgeries, which make up about 94% of all surgeries, are planned well in advance (from 4 weeks to 1 day before the surgery), while emergency surgeries, accounting for approximately 6% of the hospital's surgeries, are unplanned and must be considered immediately due to their urgent nature. \
Various units, including nurses, surgeons, anesthesia staff, pre-operative care, radiology, pathology, recovery room, and sterilization services, are involved in each surgery. Therefore, proper scheduling of operating rooms significantly impacts other hospital departments. \
On average, around 116 surgeries are performed daily in this hospital. However, the number of surgeries performed each day is not constant, with a standard deviation of about 18 surgeries on different days. This fluctuation makes workforce planning challenging. Most changes in the daily number of surgeries result from cases added due to emergencies or canceled for medical reasons the previous day. We refer to these cases as "on-add," and we aim to investigate whether they are the reasons for the daily surgery count fluctuations. \
At the end of each day, the number and type of surgeries scheduled for the next day are communicated to the surgical pathology, radiology, recovery, and anesthesia departments. Based on the number of surgeries scheduled for the next day, they are either given leave or called in for overtime. \
Given these points, it becomes clear that not knowing the exact number of surgeries a few days in advance makes planning difficult for management. Now, the hospital management intends to develop a predictive model using the existing data, in collaboration with the data analysis team, to estimate the daily number of surgeries several days in advance. This will allow sufficient time for workforce and equipment planning. \

 . For example, for the date 10/10/2010, the number of surgeries scheduled by 7 days before was 80, and this number reached 104 one day before (denoted as

 ), which is when the elective surgery schedule is finalized. Note that surgeries can be scheduled up to 28 days in advance. Additionally, there are some "on-add" cases that cause the actual number of surgeries performed on a given day to differ from the number recorded the previous day. The variable "Actual" denotes the actual number of surgeries performed each day. The variable "DOW" denotes the day of the week.
